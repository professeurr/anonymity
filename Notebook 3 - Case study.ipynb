Features utiles à la prédiction du diabète"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vGsxr7Ngde_S"},"source":["Certains attributs présents dans la base ont un lien direct avec la présence d'un diabète :\n","- *blood_sugar_reading* : un taux structurellement excessif de glycémie est associé à la présence de diabète. Cependant, ce taux peut parfois atteindre des niveaux élevés sans que la personne soit diabétique si celle-ci a par exemple consommé des aliments sucrés ;\n","- *insulin* : l'insuline est l'hormone qui régule le niveau de glycémie dans le sang. Certaines formes de diabète réclament un traitement à l'insuline (valeur 1 de l'attribut *insulin*) ;\n","- *hydration_level* : un taux élevé de glycémie dans le sang peut entraîner une augmentation du niveau de déshydratation. Puisque le taux de glycémie est associé au diabète, la feature *hydration_level* peut donc être un prédicteur du diabète ;\n","- *age* : la prévalence du diabète augmente avec l'âge, avec un effet de seuil à partir de 40 ans. La relation entre l'apparition du diabète et l'âge est donc a priori positive, et probablement non linéaire.\n","\n","Pour d'autres attributs de la base, le lien est indirect :\n","- *marital_status* : combiné avec *age* (les plus jeunes ne pouvant pas a priori être mariés ou divorcés) et dans le mesure où une personne seule peut potentiellement faire moins attention à sa santé et à son alimentation, la valeur *single* ou *divorced* peut êre associée à la présene d'un diabète ;\n","- *no_primary_dr* : une personne n'ayant pas de médecin traitant déclaré fait l'objet d'un suivi médical de moins bonne qualité et peut donc plus facilement développer un diabète ;\n","- *private_insurance* : en raison des coûts de traitement induits (pouvant aller jusqu'à la dialyse) une personne diabétique peut être tentée de souscrire une assurance privée qui prend en charge ces coûts.\n","\n","Pour certains enfin, le lien est inconnu :\n","- Aucune information n'est fournie sur la colonne *symptom_code*. On peut cependant penser que cet attribut sera utile. Typiquement, une personne atteinte de diabète peut faite un malaise lors d'un épisode d'hyper-glycémie et on peut penser qu'un malaise de ce type sera encodé avec une certaine valeur dans la liste des valeurs de symptômes possibles."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UICkdPLtde_S"},"source":["### 4.
